This is my replacement for mathb.in, which susam is closing down. There was a
problem on her part where people were uploading nonsense.

I want a more minimal service. The idea is very straightforward: encode data in
URL parameters (giving a hard limit of something like 1000 characters). Allow
people to send these URLs.

This is useful for *short* messages. For longer messages, you'll either need to
have a set of links or use a better tool to communicate math.
