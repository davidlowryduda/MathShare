        <h2>About MathShare</h2>
        <p>
        MathShare is a simple tool for mathematicians to write, preview, and
        share snippets of mathematical content using Markdown and MathJax.
        The goal is to provide an easy-to-use editor that allows seamless
        sharing of mathematical expressions.
        </p>
        <p>
        MathShare is strongly inspired by MathB.in by Susam Pal and was made
        just after Susam announced the closure of MathB.in.
        </p>
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Real-time preview of Markdown and MathJax expressions.</li>
          <li>Generate shareable URLs with embedded mathematical content.</li>
          <li>Simple markdown+mathjax printing via CSS.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>
        Type your Markdown and LaTeX math expressions in the editor. The preview updates in
        real-time (after a short delay to avoid stuttering).
        When you're ready to share, click "Generate URL" to create a shareable link containing your
        encoded content.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>All of the content is contained in that URL.</em>
          Nothing is stored on the server. (Actually this is just a static website!).
          Specifically, the URL contains a base64-encoded version of the tex+markdown, and this site
          encodes and decodes these strings.
        </p>
        <p>
          As browsers only allow URLs up to approximately 2000 characters, this imposes an
          upper limit on the length of the content to approximately 1500 characters.
          The content is then encoded to a valid data url of approximately 2000 characters (it's
          longer because there are fewer valid characters in urls).
        </p>
        <p>
          This site tries to allow simple printing of documents by removing all the unnecessary
          aspects when printing the webpage.
          Try selecting "print this page" on the main page from your browser and see for yourself.
        </p>
