# Developer Log #

I keep some notes on how this was developed.

I am using LLMs in essential ways to make this, largely using the prompts and
broad method of [this post](https://harper.blog/2025/02/16/my-llm-codegen-workflow-atm/).
Except that this is pretty small and straightforward and is overall
significantly less complicated than other projects.


## Spec and Prompt Generation ##

I had chatgpt ask me several questions about this and produce the initial spec
in [spec.markdown](spec.markdown). I also had it output [prompts for other
LLMs](llm_steps.markdown).
