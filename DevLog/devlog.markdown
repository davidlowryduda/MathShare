# Developer Log #

I keep some notes on how this was developed.

I am using LLMs in essential ways to make this, largely using the prompts and
broad method of [this post](https://harper.blog/2025/02/16/my-llm-codegen-workflow-atm/).
Except that this is pretty small and straightforward and is overall
significantly less complicated than other projects.


## Spec and Prompt Generation ##

I had chatgpt ask me several questions about this and produce the initial spec
in [spec.markdown](spec.markdown). I also had it output [prompts for other
LLMs](llm_steps.markdown).


## Prompting and Results ##

I comment on the prompts and results in my commit messages. This was a very
fast process.

I note that I also used my own site and https://colorhunt.co/palettes/popular
for some color choices at the very end. I have to do my own styling,
unfortunately --- but this is unescapable.


## Final Content Changes ##

Finally, I need to name, brand, and such. I do this on my own.
